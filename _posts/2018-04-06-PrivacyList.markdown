There are plenty of ways people can acquire your information. Most people are worried about “hackers.” There is plenty of private information that can be obtained without any type of computer intrusion or illegal activities. People want to be “anonymous” but very few people understand what that means. It’s not like you are a ghost that is invisible to the entire internet. At the end of day, you need to trust people with your information. It’s more about how much anonymity you want. It's about who you are willing to trust with your information. It’s about how much information you are willing to expose. This data can be used by businesses to personalize their services and make life easier. At the same time, most hackers are people who are very skilled at searching for tidbits of information that you have unintentionally chosen to make public. Using the information available, they can infer certian things about your life you did not make public.

Below is a list of sources to use for protecting yourself from the highest authority figures in security.

<b>Personal Tips</b>

(1) Read the terms of service. Respectable software manufacturers have to disclose what kind of information their software is accessing. It’s worth at least skimming

(2) Keep multiple identities and a password manager.

(3) Whenever people create a username, others can search for that username and collect information. You can use your identity for normal things like taxes and payment services. Everything else should have a unique name. It will be too hard to remember on it’s own, so use an extension like LastPass or 1Password that can autofill the information.
