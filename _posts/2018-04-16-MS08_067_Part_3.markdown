I decided to run Nessus on my Windows 10 PC. This is my fastest PC. It is also my most valuable, so I want to ensure that the security is air tight (without going to extream measures). I loaded up Nessus in order to anylize the machine and the software identified 2 medium level vulnurabilities.

I followed the instructions in Nessus' SMB Signing article and blocked UDP port 5353 in Windows firewall, ran the scan again and... the mDNS article did not vanish as expected. I went into Window's local group policy editor and ran the scan again. No difference. I started looking into what mDNS actually was. According to [RFC-6762][RFC-6762], mDNS (Multicast DNS) basicly makes it easier for devices to communicate over a network without the end user having to get too involved in the process. It's the reason why your iTunes can talk to other computer's iTunes so seamlessly. Although I own an iPhone, I don't really get too involved in the "Apple process," so I figured why not disable it. Thankfully iTunes itself uses something called Bonjour in order to utilize mDNS. Thankfully I can just disable it on startup.
