<b>Why Does This Exist</b>

Security is becoming increasingly important. It is becoming extremely difficult for the average man to control his information. People are adding more and more devices to their network. People are also using cloud services more. It also appears that every single proprietary function on the internet requires a username and password. The data market is becoming larger which gives companies who may or may not have people's best interest to fork over their personal information. What this means is that people's "attack surfaces" are increasing. This means that the more complex a system, the more difficult it is to secure. But you're an average person with no value and absolutely nothing to hide. So information security is irrelevant to you. Right?

After seeing how groups like Russia's Fancy Bear altered the course of an election and scandals like the ones from Cambridge Analytica, it is very clear that being cognizant of information security is a priority for a healthy society. I help friends secure their systems and profiles all the time, so why not write about my own experiences? Groups like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][eff] are very important in a society that operates primarily online.
